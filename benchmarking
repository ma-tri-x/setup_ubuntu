I put a raw case for fext40 into this repo. (see README.md)
In the constant/trisurface there is an eMesh file that was
created by me via openfoam-7 and surfaceFeatureExtract from the respective
motorbike.obj in the tutorial case that's available in the directory of 
openfoam-7/tutorials/resources/geometries/
or
foam-extend-4.0/tutorials/incompressible/simpleFoam/motorBike/constant/triSurface
